## Project Name
# <h1 style="text-align: center;color:blue;">Pet Adoption Gallery</h1>

## Description
The Pet Adoption Gallery is a web application designed to help users find their ideal pets for adoption. It showcases various pets available for adoption with detailed information, including breed, date of birth, gender, and price. Users can easily browse through the gallery and learn more about each pet.

## Key Features
1. **Dynamic Gallery**: Displays a list of pets fetched from a remote API, allowing users to see available pets in real-time.
2. **Sorting Functionality**: Users can sort pets by price, enabling them to find pets within their budget quickly.
3. **Responsive Design**: The application is mobile-friendly, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
4. **User Interactivity**: Users can like pets and view liked pet images in a dedicated section.
5. **Error Handling**: The application gracefully handles API errors and displays an informative message when no data is available.

## ES6 Features Used
- **Arrow Functions**: Used for concise function expressions.
- **Template Literals**: Used for embedding expressions in strings, making the HTML generation cleaner.
- **Async/Await**: Utilized for handling asynchronous operations when fetching pet data from the API.
- **Destructuring Assignment**: Used to extract properties from objects, making the code more readable.
- **Spread Operator**: Employed for combining arrays and objects in a concise way.
